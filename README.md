# MITx6.00.1x_IntroToCS

In this course you’ll be learning the basics of computer programming in Python and the fundamentals of computation, as well as
getting the opportunity to implement your own Python functions.
Grading Policy
In this course there will be many types of assignments. Your final grade will be a weighted average of the following:
Finger exercises (available within each lecture video sequence) – 10%
Problem sets – 40%
Midterm – 25%
Final exam – 25%
In order to earn a certificate for 6.00.1x, students must pass the course with a grade of C or better. The following grading breakdown will apply:
= 80%: A
= 65%: B
= 55%: C
Exams are scheduled in advance. The exams will take place online, on the course website. Exams are timed – once you begin during
the exam period, you will have 8 hours to complete it. The Midterm will take place from July 5, 2019 (14:00 UTC) to July 9,
2019 (23:30 UTC). The Final Exam will take place from August 2, 2019 (14:00 UTC) to August 6, 2019 (23:30 UTC)
