# MITx6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

An introduction to computer science as a tool to solve real-world analytical problems using Python 3.5. Eric Grimson, Bernard Gordon Professor of Medical Engineering, Professor of Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. 
In this course youâ€™ll be learning the basics of computer programming in Python and the fundamentals of computation, as well as
getting the opportunity to implement your own Python functions.

Topics covered include:

    A Notion of computation
    The Python programming language
    Some simple algorithms
    Testing and debugging
    An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
    Data structures
