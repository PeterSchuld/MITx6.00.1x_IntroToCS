# MITx6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. 
In this course youâ€™ll be learning the basics of computer programming in Python and the fundamentals of computation, as well as
getting the opportunity to implement your own Python functions.

Topics:

    A Notion of computation
    The Python programming language
    Some simple algorithms
    Testing and debugging
    An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
    Data structures
